This repository demonstrates a common but easily overlooked error in Express.js applications: improper handling of asynchronous operations that might throw errors. The `bug.js` file shows an example of how an unhandled error in an asynchronous function will not send an error response to the client, resulting in a poor user experience. The `bugSolution.js` shows the corrected version with proper error handling.
